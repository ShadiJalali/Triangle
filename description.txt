I supposed an interface(Shape) for all types of shapes that have 2 methods,
one for validate the input params and another for get specific category of the shape.

I assumed an InvalidShapeException that is thrown for invalid input params while creating the shape objects.

I wrote a Triangle class with all methods that is requeted in challenge.

Also TriangleType enum that represent all types of the triangle.

And TriangleClient to use the classes.

And finally Junit tests.
